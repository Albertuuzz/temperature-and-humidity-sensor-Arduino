# Temperature-and-humidity-sensor-Arduino

This is a tutorial on how to make a temperature and humidity sensor using an Elegoo Uno R3 Arduino. To do this, we will need the following parts:

    - LCD display
    - Breadboard
    - Potentiometer
    - DHT11 sensor (also works for DHT22)
    - Cables, with both male ends

The first thing we will do is assemble our circuit. It's simple, just follow the following diagram:

Remember that the red and black wires are for power (5v) and ground, respectively. Next, I'm going to make some clarifications piece by piece:

-   Humidity and temperature sensor: For this practice, I am using the DHT11 although you can use the DHT22. However, I am going to clarify some things about       the DHT11. There are two versions of the DHT11, one that comes with an LED and another that comes without an LED. In the version that comes with an LED,        each pin will be detailed as VCC, Ground or Data Pin. In my case, I have the DHT11 without an LED, so it's enough to follow the above diagram.

-   Potentiometer: For the practice, I have been using a 3-pin potentiometer, specifically the B103. I have two pins facing forward and one facing backward.         This last one is dedicated to regulating the sensitivity of the LED screen (This is important because the data may be showing on the LCD, and you may not       have noticed it due to not adjusting the potentiometer), so once you have it assembled, remember to adjust the potentiometer.

-   LCD display: We have a 16-pin LCD, the 3rd pin is the one that regulates the amount of light it should emit (it is adjusted with the potentiometer).

-   Arduino Uno: Remember to connect the Arduino to the computer via USB and then, using the Arduino IDE, run the program to display the data on the LCD.
