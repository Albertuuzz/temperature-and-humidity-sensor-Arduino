# Temperature-and-humidity-sensor-Arduino

This is a tutorial on how to make a temperature and humidity sensor using an Elegoo Uno R3 Arduino. To do this, we will need the following parts:

    - LCD display
    - Breadboard
    - Potentiometer
    - DHT11 sensor (also works for DHT22)
    - Cables, with both male ends

The first thing we will do is assemble our circuit. It's simple, just follow the following diagram:
